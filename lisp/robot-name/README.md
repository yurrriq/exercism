# Robot Name

Write a program that manages robot factory settings.

When robots come off the factory floor, they have no name.

The first time you boot them up, a random name is generated, such as
RX837 or BC811.

Every once in a while we need to reset a robot to its factory settings,
which means that their name gets wiped. The next time you ask, it gets a
new name.

Random names means a risk of collisions. In some exercism language
tracks there are tests to ensure that the same name is never used twice.

Check out
[Exercism Help](http://help.exercism.io/getting-started-with-lisp.html)
for instructions to get started writing Common Lisp. That page will
explain how to install and setup a Lisp implementation and how to run
the tests.
