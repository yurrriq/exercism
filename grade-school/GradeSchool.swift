/**
Store students' names along with the grade they are in.

Usage:

- Add a student's name to the roster for a grade
  - "Add Jim to grade 2."
  - "OK."
- Get a list of all students enrolled in a grade
  - "Which students are in grade 2?"
  - "We've only got Jim just now."
- Get a sorted list of all students in all grades.  Grades should sort
  as 1, 2, 3, etc., and students within a grade should be sorted
  alphabetically by name.
  - "Who all is enrolled in school right now?"
  - "Grade 1: Anna, Barb, and Charlie. Grade 2: Alex, Peter and Zoe.
    Grade 3â€¦"

This exercise was inspired by a pairing session with Phil Battos at [gSchool](http://gschool.it).

- remark: All our students only have one name. (It's a small town. What do you want?)
