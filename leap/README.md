# Leap

Write a program that will take a year and report if it is a leap year.

The tricky thing here is that a leap year occurs:

```plain
on every year that is evenly divisible by 4
  except every year that is evenly divisible by 100
    unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400
```

For example, 1997 is not a leap year, but 1996 is.  1900 is not a leap
year, but 2000 is.

If your language provides a method in the standard library that does
this look-up, pretend it doesn't exist and implement it yourself.

## Notes

For a delightful, four minute explanation of the whole leap year
phenomenon, go watch [this youtube video][video].

No additional dependencies should be required.

Sometimes module functions will be loaded that are useful to the problem case.
You'll see them in the `define-package` macro at the top of the source file,
thus: `#:autoload (mod submod) (function0 function1)`. The curious can read
about included modules [here][0].

If you need help getting set up, see [Getting Started With Scheme][1]
in the [Exercism.io Help][2] pages.
