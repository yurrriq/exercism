# Bob

Bob is a lackadaisical teenager. In conversation, his responses are very limited.

Bob answers 'Sure.' if you ask him a question.

He answers 'Whoa, chill out!' if you yell at him.

He says 'Fine. Be that way!' if you address him without actually saying
anything.

He answers 'Whatever.' to anything else.

## Instructions

Run the test file, and fix each of the errors in turn. When you get the
first test to pass, go to the first pending or skipped test, and make
that pass as well. When all of the tests are passing, feel free to
submit.

Remember that passing code is just the first step. The goal is to work
towards a solution that is as readable and expressive as you can make
it.

Please make your solution as general as possible. Good code doesn't just
pass the test suite, it works with any input that fits the
specification.

Have fun!

For installation and learning resources, refer to the
[exercism help page](http://help.exercism.io/getting-started-with-racket.html).

You can run the provided tests through DrRacket, or via the command line.

To run the test through DrRacket, simply open the test file and click the 'Run' button in the upper right.

To run the test from the command line, simply run the test from the exercise directory. For example, if the test suite is called `hello-world-test.rkt`, you can run the following command:

```
raco test hello-world-test.rkt
```

which will display the following:

```
raco test: (submod "hello-world-test.rkt" test)
2 success(es) 0 failure(s) 0 error(s) 2 test(s) run
0
2 tests passed
```
