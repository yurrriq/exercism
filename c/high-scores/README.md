If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

Manage a game player's High Score list.

Your task is to build a high-score component of the classic Frogger game, one of the highest selling and most addictive games of all time, and a classic of the arcade era.
Your task is to write methods that return the highest score from the list, the last added score and the three highest scores.

The functions in this exercise accept an array containing one or more numbers, each representing one 'game score'.

The player's game scores can be read from

| `scores`   |
|---|
| `scores[0]` |
| `scores[1]` |
| ... |
| `scores[scores_len - 1]` |

`personal_top_three()` should write the player's top scores to
