# List Ops

Implement basic list operations

In functional languages list operations like `length`, `map`, and
`reduce` are very common. Implement a series of basic list operations,
without using existing functions.

## Running Tests

Because OCaml is a compiled language you need to compile your submission and the test code before you can run the tests. Compile with

```bash
$ corebuild -quiet test.native
```

and when successful run the tests by running the `test.native` executable:

```bash
./test.native
```

Alternatively just type

```bash
make
```
