// Depending on your implementation, there are a variety of potential errors

// allow the greatest freedom of implementation, but real libraries should
// provide useful, descriptive errors so that downstream code can react
// appropriately.
//
// One common idiom is to define an Error enum which wraps all potential
// errors. Another common idiom is to use a helper type such as failure::Error
// which does more or less the same thing but automatically.
