# Bob

Bob is a lackadaisical teenager. In conversation, his responses are very limited.

Bob answers 'Sure.' if you ask him a question.

He answers 'Whoa, chill out!' if you yell at him.

He says 'Fine. Be that way!' if you address him without actually saying
anything.

He answers 'Whatever.' to anything else.

## Instructions

Run the test file, and fix each of the errors in turn. When you get the
first test to pass, go to the first pending or skipped test, and make
that pass as well. When all of the tests are passing, feel free to
submit.

Remember that passing code is just the first step. The goal is to work
towards a solution that is as readable and expressive as you can make
it.

Please make your solution as general as possible. Good code doesn't just
pass the test suite, it works with any input that fits the
specification.

Have fun!


No additional dependencies should be required.

Sometimes module functions will be loaded that are useful to the problem case.
You'll see them in the `define-package` macro at the top of the source file,
thus: `#:autoload (mod submod) (function0 function1)`. The curious can read
about included modules [here][0].

If you need help getting set up, see [Getting Started With Scheme][1]
in the [Exercism.io Help][2] pages.
