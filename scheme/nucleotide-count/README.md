# Nucleotide Count

Given a DNA string, compute how many times each nucleotide occurs in the string.

DNA is represented by an alphabet of the following symbols: 'A', 'C',
'G', and 'T'.

Each symbol represents a nucleotide, which is a fancy name for the
particular molecules that happen to make up a large part of DNA.

Shortest intro to biochemistry EVAR:

- twigs are to birds nests as
- nucleotides are to DNA and RNA as
- amino acids are to proteins as
- sugar is to starch as
- oh crap lipids

I'm not going to talk about lipids because they're crazy complex.

So back to nucleotides.

DNA contains four types of them: adenine (`A`), cytosine (`C`), guanine
(`G`), and thymine (`T`).

RNA contains a slightly different set of nucleotides, but we don't care
about that for now.

No additional dependencies should be required.

Sometimes module functions will be loaded that are useful to the problem case.
You'll see them in the `define-package` macro at the top of the source file,
thus: `#:autoload (mod submod) (function0 function1)`. The curious can read
about included modules [here][0].

If you need help getting set up, see [Getting Started With Scheme][1]
in the [Exercism.io Help][2] pages.
